If Yi Sang's depiction is correct, that plate is almost certainly a calendar."

I had no reason to fear, for I would be brought back to life even if I were to perish.\nI did not feel the death, so to speak. Though I have experienced death many times in battle, I was not subjected to the sort of pain or flashing disarray that normally accompanies a demise that time. It simply felt as though I was being transported to a different location.\nIt may be the universe or some other dimension.\nMy own body and voice couldn't be perceived by my senses. Perhaps my eyes had gone and I became part of that place.\nThere, I may have seen the end. You could say it was a doomsday I witnessed.\nNo perhaps I may have been the end and the doomsday I was present at the end but not existent and while it may be misleading to say that it was there but even still I witnessed man and sky and earth tear into thousands of pieces\n[The rest is neatly censored with a correction tape.]\n→ I had Yi Sang talk with the recovery staff from After Team for a moment. His psychological corruption seems rather severe. Dante, I think we should refrain from making our observers directly experience these events from now on."
